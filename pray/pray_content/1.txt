John 3:9 @@Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
Lord, we look to You to grace us and guide us again, through Your life-giving Spirit. We want to be fully open to You to receive more of You, to take in Your riches, and to enjoy Your fullness.
