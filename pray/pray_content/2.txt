James 3:2@@For in many things we offend all.If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
Lord, we are here for touching You deeply in the depths of Your word. We do not want to be skating on the surface; we desire to go down to the bottom to see Your heart.
